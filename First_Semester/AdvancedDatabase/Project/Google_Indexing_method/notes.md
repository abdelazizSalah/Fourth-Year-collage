* Google Correlate was a tool offered by Google that allowed users to find search patterns that corresponded with real-world trends and events. It was launched in 2011 and was designed to help users discover interesting relationships between search query patterns and various phenomena.Google Correlate worked by analyzing patterns in search queries over time and identifying queries that exhibited similar patterns to a user-provided search term or data series. This tool was particularly useful for marketers, researchers, and data analysts who wanted to understand the popularity of specific search terms and their correlation with specific events or trends.
* However, it's important to note that Google Correlate was discontinued in 2019. Google did not provide a specific reason for discontinuing the service, but it may have been due to changes in their data analysis tools and services. As of my last update in January 2022, Google Correlate is no longer available for use.
* Opinion: Google Correlate was a valuable tool for researchers and analysts looking to explore the relationship between online search behavior and real-world events. Its discontinuation might have disappointed users who found it helpful in their work. However, Google regularly updates its services, and it's possible that they have integrated similar features into other tools or platforms since then
