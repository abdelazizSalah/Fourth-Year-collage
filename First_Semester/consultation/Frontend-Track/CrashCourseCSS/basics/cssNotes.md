## inline elements vs block elements
* inline elements: elements that don't take the whole width of the page, and they don't have a line break after them.
* block elements: elements that take the whole width of the page, and they have a line break after them.
* examples on both: 
  * inline elements: span, a, img, input, button, label, select, textarea, ...
  * block elements: div, p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, ul, ol, li, table, form, header, footer, section, article, nav, aside, ...
* we can nest inline elements inside block elements, but we can't nest block elements inside inline elements, nor nest block elements inside each other.
