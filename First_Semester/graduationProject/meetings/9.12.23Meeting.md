# Notes 

## What is the application flow.
* All the features are executed on-demand.
* The user can access our app in two ways
  1. using voice commands. 
  2. using the GUI, with the assistance of the voice over features of the os.   
### for Navigation
* There are 4 options. 
  1. Navigate and avoid obstacles only -> behind the scene we are forming our map. 
  2. Navigate to a specific location -> we are using the pre-generated map.
  3. building a map 
     * in this option, a normal user start navigating in the environment and allowing us to build a map for the location. 
  4. once he reached a specific location, he can save a label for it. (to be able to support a path planning algorithm).
   > The directions given to the user are all voice commands.
### for OCR 
* The user should scan a paper, and we will provide him with the results using a voice response.
* also he can scan money.

### for scene description
* The user should scan the surrounding environment, and we will provide him with the results using a voice response.
* also we will support an objects matching feature, to be able to find specific objects.

### Why to use VSLAM 
* Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods refer to the SLAM approaches that employ cameras for pose estimation and map reconstruction and are preferred over Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)-based
methods due to their lighter weight, lower acquisition costs, and richer environment representation.

### Things to search for
* What is the direct feature extraction. 
* Triangularization.
* bundle adjustment.
* Data association.

### Notes About VSLAM Design
- Key frames play a crucial role in Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems, serving as reference points for localization and tracking. Their selection is typically based on significant visual changes, often induced by camera movements. Here are some opinions on the importance and implications of key frames in Visual SLAM literature:

    1. Essential Landmarks:
    Key frames are like milestones in the SLAM process. They represent unique moments in the video sequence where the scene undergoes substantial changes. By selecting key frames, SLAM algorithms can focus on extracting and matching distinctive features, turning these frames into essential landmarks for mapping.

    2. Localization Precision:
    The use of key frames contributes to improving the precision of localization. As the algorithm identifies and tracks features between key frames, it can refine the estimation of the camera pose more accurately. This precision is vital for applications like robotics and augmented reality, where accurate localization is crucial.

    3. Computational Efficiency:
    Key frames also play a role in optimizing computational efficiency. Since processing every frame in a video sequence can be computationally intensive, selecting key frames allows SLAM systems to allocate resources more effectively, concentrating on frames that provide the most valuable information for mapping and localization.

- Feature searching and extraction are integral components of visual tracking in computer vision and image processing. These processes involve identifying distinctive visual features in an image or a sequence of images to track objects accurately over time. Here are some opinions on feature searching and extraction in tracking:

    1. Importance of Distinctive Features:
    Identifying and extracting distinctive features are crucial for effective object tracking. These features act as unique landmarks or reference points that the tracking algorithm uses to follow the object through different frames. The choice of distinctive features significantly impacts the robustness of the tracking system.

    2. Robustness to Illumination and Occlusion:
    Well-chosen features enhance the robustness of tracking systems against changes in illumination and occlusion. Features that are invariant to lighting conditions and can be reliably detected even when parts of the object are temporarily hidden contribute to the system's ability to maintain tracking accuracy in challenging scenarios.

    3. Real-time Performance:
    The efficiency of feature searching and extraction is vital, especially in real-time tracking applications. Algorithms need to identify and extract features swiftly to ensure timely updates of the object's position. Balancing accuracy with computational efficiency is a common consideration in designing tracking systems.
